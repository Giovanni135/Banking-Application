# Banking-Application
Simple banking app that creates accounts. 
Takes in a new customer and creates a Savings, Checking, stores an initial deposit and has basic banking functions for each account type such as interest rate calculation.
Project utilizies Java and was a way to practice OOP principles such as inheritence, encapsulation as well as working with an interface.
Still working on a CSV reader.
